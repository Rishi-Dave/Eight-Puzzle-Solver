# Eight-Puzzle-Solver
Project for my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CS170) course. I created multiple A* algorithms with varying heuristics along with a uniform cost search as a control to solve the classic "Eight Puzzle" problem. I then analyze the algorithms by comparing their outputs on varying input difficulties.
