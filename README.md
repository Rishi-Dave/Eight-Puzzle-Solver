# Eight-Puzzle-Solver
Project for our Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CS170) course. We created multiple A* algorithms with varying heuristics along with a uniform cost search as a control to solve the classic "Eight Puzzle" problem. We then analyzed the algorithms by comparing their outputs on varying input difficulties.
